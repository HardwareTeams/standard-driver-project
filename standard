# Standards

## Intro

This document outlines all rules which must be followed to commit a new driver. 

## Requirements

1. The driver shall be written in c
2. The driver shall be a single header file (`.h`)  and a single source file `.c` file
3. The driver shall not have any additional dependencies
4. The driver shall provide a function to read and write to the IC through every mode of communication the IC supports (example: I2C, SPI)
5. The function in (4) shall contain a commented section where the user can add device/platform specific code at time of use
6. Register names shall be defined in the header file and match datasheet name **exactly** (i.e. case sensitive). If there are spaces in the register name they shall be replaced with an underscore `_`
   
    | register name | name in header file | 
    | --- | --- |
    | Power Management 1 | Power_Management_1 |
    
7. Bit field names shall be defined in the header file and match datasheet name **exactly** (i.e. case sensitive). If there are spaces in the bit field name they shall be replaced with underscore `_`
8. Each bitfield
